Coronavirus EDA and modeling for U.S. counties

# Coronavirus Cases Modeling

This project, written in R, explores the coronavirus spread rate in U.S. counties by way of exponential and power curve modeling.  The goal is to understand if the spread of the virus is increasing, leveling, or decreasing on a county by county basis, with the aim of identifying that happy time when coronavirus cases are on the decline.

## Installation

This R code can be run in R, R Studio, R in Jupyter notebooks, or R in any incarnation.  It requires:

* data.table
* dplyr
* rvest

and features use of the nls function from the stats package for fitting non-linear models.
